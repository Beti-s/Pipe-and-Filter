Pipe and Filter Concept â€“ Word Processor Example
This project demonstrates the Pipe and Filter architectural pattern using a Word Processor as a case study. The Pipe and Filter pattern is widely used in software design to process data in a modular, sequential manner.

In this implementation, text input passes through multiple independent filters (processing stages), each performing a specific transformation or operation, such as:
ðŸ”¹ Spell Checking â€“ Identifies and highlights misspelled words.
ðŸ”¹ Grammar Correction â€“ Suggests improvements for sentence structure.
ðŸ”¹ Text Formatting â€“ Applies styles like bold, italics, or alignment.
ðŸ”¹ Keyword Highlighting â€“ Emphasizes important words or phrases.

Each filter operates independently and processes data from the previous stage, forming a pipeline of transformations. This approach improves scalability, reusability, and maintainability of the system.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used: Java, Design Patterns, OOP
ðŸ“Œ Concepts Applied: Modularity, Data Flow Processing, Software Architecture

This project enhances flexibility and extensibility by allowing new filters to be added without modifying existing components. Looking forward to expanding its features! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
